    title: 'Why Education is Important ?',
    img: "assets/blogs/education.jpg",
    date: "May 19, 2023",
    desc1: `Education is not how well you can read and write but whether you can communicate with and understand the world around you. A good education not only teaches you skills but also helps you broaden your horizons, gain better perspective, and teaches you to think for yourself. People today are quite aware and comfortable speaking about social injustices and other pressing issues. This can be attributed to the increased access to education around the world, which in turn has made society more accepting and open-minded. Therefore, education is an element of human evolution. The importance of education is also pronounced in areas of creativity and innovation. Education encourages thinking outside the box and experimenting with new ideas.`,
    desc2head:`1. Realizing your true potential`,    
    desc2:` 
    A good education helps you recognize yourself and your strengths. As you learn about the world and yourself, you come across things that interest you. You find things you are good at and figure out how you can contribute and help the world grow.
    
    Education gives you opportunities to explore yourself, and your surroundings and empowers you to understand the ways of the world. It gives you the freedom to live a life of your choice.`,
    desc3head:`2. Sharpening critical skills`,
    desc3:` 
    Education helps you develop critical skills like decision-making, mental agility, problem-solving, and logical thinking. People face problems in their professional as well as personal lives. In such situations, their ability to make rational and informed decisions comes from how educated and self-aware they are.
    
    Education also breeds creativity and innovation. When you take time to understand how the world works presently, only then can you come up with solutions and alternatives for existing problems.`,
    desc4head:`3. More opportunities `,
    desc4:`
    Education opens up new avenues. When you invest in educating yourself about a particular subject, you broaden your perspective in that area. As a result, you get opportunities to test and enhance your skillset. When you attend college or become a part of an organization, you get to meet the right people. You become a part of a community and also discover new things about yourself.
    
    Moreover, as you educate yourself, you are learning something new every day without even realizing it. Your accolades in college and otherwise are indicative of your competence and can open doors for you.`,
    desc5head:`4. Financial stability`,
    desc5:` 
    Yet another benefit of having a strong educational background is financial stability. Students who graduate from esteemed colleges have a higher chance of landing well-paying jobs. The more knowledge you gain, the more skilled you become, and hence more opportunities open for you. If you are good at something and know your way around it, rest assured you will be compensated well.`,
    desc6head:`5. Supporting a developed society`,
    desc6:`
    Education is imperative when it comes to building a modern society. When people learn about things like culture, history, and science, they can view problems from a much-informed perspective. Education teaches values and helps in the development of society as a whole. It gives people a chance to mold themselves into more responsible members of society.
    
    Educated individuals are also more likely to get well-paying jobs and engage in effective trade and commerce practices. These, in turn, contribute to driving more capital to the economy. Hence, education drives growth in countries and supports a developing society.`,
    desc7head:`6. Giving back to the community`,
    desc7:` 
    helping people - importance of education
    Education brings people together. You need people to show you new possibilities.
    When people can afford a stable life for themselves, they are more likely to take the initiative to solve local problems. Education enables people to be self-dependent. It also teaches people the need for a stable and secure community. As a result, people join hands to help the less fortunate and solve the community’s most pressing issues.
    
    The importance of education is at the forefront when it comes to social issues. No matter if it is the education of maintaining clean neighborhoods, practicing good sanitation, or knowing your rights. People can lift other people only by exposing them to new possibilities by educating them.`,
    desc8head:`7. Blurring geographical boundaries`,
    desc8:`
    The importance of education is especially pronounced when we want to communicate with people from different cultures across the world. When we have a wide knowledge base, it is easy for us to find common ground with someone from a different place.
    
    Digital mediums of learning and spreading information have played an instrumental role in bridging this gap. They have allowed more people to connect, interact and learn. This new way of teaching and learning has blurred geographical boundaries and contributed to sharing insights and opinions, broadening the horizons of all involved.`,
    desc9head:`8. Equal opportunities `,
    desc9:`
    Education helps us create equal opportunities. People from different genders, religions, castes, races, and cultures have multiple possibilities laid out in front of them because of education. They in turn strive to create more opportunities for others, even if only within their community. Education has made filling an irrational rift possible by making merit the only criterion for judgment.
    
    Education makes people more tolerant of others. It makes them more open-minded, so they can accept different views and opinions. This further opens the gates for equal opportunities and a better standard of living for everyone.`,
    desc10head:`9. As a tool for empowerment`,
    desc10:`
    empowering people
    Empowering someone with knowledge is the best way you can help them.
    As mentioned above, education is the most powerful tool in the world. Minority sections are usually left unseen and ignored despite their potential. Educating these sections of society not only initiates their growth but also the growth of society because empowered people empower people.
    
    For instance, increased education rates for women have led more women to join the workforce across various industries and stand up against the inequality they face. More and more women are being empowered through education, which has helped in the creation of a more inclusive and empathetic society. There is still a long way to go, but the importance of education in empowering sections of society cannot be overlooked.`,

    date: "May 19, 2023",
    desc1: `In the changing times when families are becoming nuclear with one or two children per family, a change has been observed in the process of parenting and teaching. Teaching more so, because the expectations of parents from the school have changed a lot.`,
    desc2: `Earlier, when the students had limited access to the learning content, the desire to acquire a new skill was strong. It was an impetus to learning. Today, in small families where children get individual attention and aren’t used to hearing no for an answer, teaching acquires a new challenge in scope and dimension. The youth are also social media savvy. They are in tune with the trends but also have a deficit attention span. This prompts a major shift in a teacher’s requisite skills to effectively deliver instruction and ensure good learning outcomes. 

    In the backdrop of such challenging times, schools and teachers are mostly the last significant resort to nurture the impetuous student into an ideal citizen of the future. Following are the most important skills that teachers must have to save the day. `,
    desc3:` Teachers must develop this quality and have the right attitude towards students. It is possible that students may appear difficult to handle at times. This has to do more with our generation where technology and other changes are phenomenal. Students behave as per the mechanism of the survival of the fittest. For them knowing their ‘like’ scores and fan following is just another way of being the fittest. Making sure that we reach out to them when they need us, lend them an empathetic ear, and be their confidante is a great skill to possess. `,
    desc4:` Teachers must have the right values that they should exemplify to students. They should manifest these values in their behaviour and speech. For example, all teachers must know that good language has a direct relationship with self-control and hence it must be practiced at all the times. Values like patience, respect for peers, perseverance, tolerance for disagreements can best be taught by examples of behaviour set by the teacher and emulated by learners. `,
    desc5:`With the advent of the internet, copious amount of information is available easily. So the teacher has to have the skill to convert information into knowledge for students so that it becomes useful for them. This process, when done regularly, should sow the seeds of learning amongst students, to spark their curiosity, and help them evolve as lifelong learners even when they are out of school.    `,
    desc6:`With more and more IT interventions being adopted in school education, teachers must keep themselves abreast with the latest technology. This will enable them to integrate technology in teaching programmes.    `,
    desc7:`All teachers must be aware of the 17 SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) and create awareness in students regarding the environment and issues related to the global societal concerns. No opportunity should be lost to teach the importance of the environment. The human greed and apathy are the primary reasons that are fuelling environmental disaster. In that respect, right values of conservation, preservation and austerity must be instilled in today’s learners.`,
    desc8:`The teacher must be able to inspire students to look at the world as one family and should make students aware that we are one Human Race and we should not divide ourselves by caste, creed or religion. All humanity is one family and the teacher must take the opportunity to teach students the importance of amity and fraternity to ensure a safer and unified world. `,
    desc9:`The Covid pandemic has taught us the importance of health for people of all ages. It’s crucial for the teacher to possess the knowledge of the health promoting practices, constituting nutrition, diet, exercises, and habits. The balanced life of a harmonious physical, mental and emotional development must be shown as an example to students so that they too get inspired towards healthy living. This, in turn, will make them more responsible and fitter citizens of the future.  `,
    desc10:` In today’s times, teachers need to possess these skills to be competent at their job. Additionally, they have to continually upskill and reskill so that they keep abreast of the changes in the ever-evolving education system across the world.  `,

  management: {
    title: "Importance of Management",
    img: "assets/blogs/management.jpg",
    date: "May 19, 2023",
    desc1: `Management steers the activities of an organisation towards its goals. It is, therefore, integral to have competent managers at the helm of different business functions. Be it a manufacturing enterprise, a technology firm, a retail business, or a nonprofit, managers are required everywhere. `,
    desc2head:`1. Achieving Group Goals`,    
    desc2:`
    Organisations employ people with different backgrounds and qualifications. And it is the management’s responsibility to ensure that the employees’ diverse skill sets are directed towards a common goal. For example, a marketing manager has to organise and manage designers, content creators, social media analysts, etc., ascertaining that all materials meet the brand guidelines and campaign targets. As the dynamics of work continue to evolve in the digital era, it is crucial to have managers who can masterfully lead teams in keeping with the current realities.
    
    As for the hiring trends, candidates who have a basic understanding of management concepts and industry exposure in a particular domain are usually in high demand. Most leading management programmes address this need by including case studies and projects that simulate best practices in the real world.`,
    desc3head:`2. Increasing Efficiency`,
    desc3:`Management is concerned with accomplishing more with less. Most managerial tasks aim to achieve maximum output with fewer resources, including employees, money, materials, machinery or technology. In other words, managers carry out specific duties of planning, organising, staffing, directing, and controlling to allocate the inputs in ways that result in higher profitability and performance. 
    Productivity and efficiency of managers are valued across industries as it eliminates mistakes and repeated steps in achieving business goals. As an aspirant, you can demonstrate these abilities to prospective employers through your innovative thinking, project work, and achievements. If you are enrolled in an executive management programme while pursuing a job, it is a direct testament to your self-motivation and time-management skills. `,
    desc4head:`3. Creating Dynamic Organisations`,
    desc4:`
    Resistance to change is one of the biggest barriers to organisational success. The modern world of work is full of new technological capabilities and opportunities waiting to be harnessed. Managers are expected to embrace these developments and changes. Moreover, they have to apply strategic innovation and analytical skills to deal with emerging challenges. A prime example is learning programming languages and tools like R Studio, SPSS, Google Analytics, WordPress, etc. Working knowledge of data analytics is also transferable to a wide range of careers. 
    
    Industry-oriented training from reputed business schools can provide a good starting point to refine these skills. It is best to choose a programme of study that allows you the flexibility and freedom to learn at your own pace.`,
    desc5head:`4. Creating Robust Processes`,
    desc5:`
    Management strives to optimise the use of physical and human resources in an organisation. It uses expert insights, professional services, and technical skills to minimise wastage, reduce costs, and achieve more remarkable outcomes. For this to happen, business leaders and managers try to establish specific procedures and coordinated functions. 
    
    Management education can equip candidates with the fundamentals of authority and responsibility relationships, chain of command, organisational behaviour, human resource management, change management, business strategy, etc. Knowledge and skills in these areas are hard to come by without an education that follows a hands-on approach. `,
    desc6head:`5. Maintaining Organisational Culture`,
    desc6:`
    Management acts as a creative and motivational force for all departments in an organisation. It invigorates different business functions and adds valuable inputs to the ongoing work. Experienced managers know that they are expected to forge ahead with farsighted planning and vision. To do this successfully, they need to go deeper, identify alternative courses of action, and make data-driven decisions.
    
    Whether you are a fresh graduate or a senior-level executive, academic training in management can help you develop this analytical approach. Candidates should opt for a course that includes relevant industry projects and assignments. `,
    desc7head:`6. Aiding Technical and Social Innovation`,
    desc7:`
    As a multidisciplinary field, management reflects upon and responds to the current and future economic development issues. In practice, it incorporates technology and social practices that move the needle for the better. This involves addressing the needs through technical means, data, and knowledge besides exploring and implementing new ideas. Setting up a social media strategy or finding customers for a digital startup are prime examples of such activities. 
    
    If you are interested in entering the management sector, select a study option with the right combination of technical tools and soft skills. It would help you make a smooth transition into modern workplaces. `,
    desc8head:`7. Contributing to Society`,
    desc8:`
    Organisations have many obligations towards society. The management has to orient the processes to the greater good. For example, when a business produces better quality goods, it improves the standard of living, generates employment opportunities, and increases the nation’s wealth. 
    
    Contemporary management programmes focus on leveraging data and insights for customer-centric decisions. After all, there would be no business without a thriving society.
    
    This rounds up our list on the importance of management in the 21st century. Let us now see how it can transform your personality. `,
